    "Programming languages are broadly divided into the compilation and scripting systems. Compilation means writing instructions and then converting them into machine language. The machine language becomes completely indecipherable to ordinary people (although there are a few who can read it), but the computer understands the machine language and can execute the instructions at high speed. To convert a file with written instructions (called a source file, etc.) into machine language, software called a compiler is needed. In C and Java, a compiler is used to translate a source file written by a human into machine language, and the computer executes the translated file.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in the scripting system, a file with written instructions can be executed by a computer as is. Although the execution speed is inferior to machine language, it is easy to try out the instructions. A file with written instructions is called a script. Python, Perl, Ruby, and R are script programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Script languages are said to be easier to write than compiled languages. For example, compiled languages strictly distinguish whether a number is a real number (real number, double, float) or an integer (integer). For example, in the compiled C language, if you want to treat the integer 2 as an integer, you need to assign int x =2; if it is a real number (floating point type), you need to assign double pi = 3.14159265359; or float pi = 3.14159265359f; (the assignments are explained in the following movie 1 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In scripting languages, on the other hand, you do not need to be so conscious of \"type\" when performing assignments; if X=2, whether it is an integer or a real number is often determined by the context (the relationship before and after the instruction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows an example of assigning 10 to `x` and dividing by 3 in C and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/int_c.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In C, the type of a variable is important, and here the type is specified as int (integer). Therefore, the result of dividing by 3 is still an integer (the decimal point is not shown).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, on the other hand, even if an integer is assigned to `x`, the result of the operation (division) is displayed as a real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/python_int.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Various languages are used in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence. In data analysis, compiler-based languages have been used mainly because of the load of data processing and computation, but libraries (modules) with faster speeds in C and other languages have been actively introduced in the background with Python and R, enabling faster and more efficient processing even in scripting languages. This has enabled fast and efficient processing even in scripting languages.\n",
    "The scripting languages Python and R have simplified the sequence of writing and executing code (called development) by loosening type restrictions, etc., and in this sense, their work efficiency is extremely high. In addition, not only are there an abundance of modules that are strong in numerical and statistical processing, but they can also be applied to the construction of websites and other applications. In addition, it is open source, with no OS restrictions, free of charge, and free to use by anyone, and there are basically no restrictions on its development for commercial purposes. For this reason, Python and R are very popular in the data science and AI fields and are widely used around the world."
