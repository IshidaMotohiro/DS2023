    "Let us assume that the company under discussion has 100 employees. In this case, it is necessary to be able to clearly distinguish,for example, between 20 managers and the rest general employees, and so on. Or, the general employees may be further classified into \"career-track\" and \"general\" positions, but in any case, it can be determined that they are not in management positions.\n",
    "\n",

This means that there is an order of \"excellent\" > \"good\" > \"acceptable\" > \"not acceptable\". In this case, it is sometimes specifically referred to as an ordinal categorical variable (however, a rather complex method is required to conduct data analysis that considers order in the levels of categorical variables).\n",

    "It is easier to understand the interval scale by mapping it to the proportional scale. The **proportionality scale** has a defined origin, or \"no\" state, and is also data that has meaning in terms of intervals and ratios. (The possibility of actually taking a value of 0 is a different story here. If you weighed a dog, there would be no such thing as a dog weighing 0 grams, but it makes no difference that the dog's weight is a proportional measure.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"speed\" has a value of 0. We can say that 20 km/h is twice the speed of 10 km/h, and 30 km/h is three times the speed of 10 km/h. Also, the interval from 10 km/h to 20 km/h is equal to the interval from 20 km/h to 30 km/h. The weight of 10 kilograms is twice the weight of 5 kilograms, 20 kilograms is four times the weight of 5 kilograms, and 30 kilograms is six times the weight of 5 kilograms. In the case of an increase in body weight from 50 to 60 kilograms and from 100 to 110 kilograms, the increase is 10 kilograms in both cases, but the increase is 20% in the former case, while the increase is 10% in the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the **interval scale** has meaning in terms of the size of the difference between the values, and the value 0 has only relative meaning. In other words, it is data in which the difference (distance) between values has meaning, but the ratio is not considered. For example, with regard to the temperature used in daily life in Japan (Celsius temperature), if the temperature rises from 10 to 15 degrees Celsius, or from 50 to 55 degrees Celsius, it can be said that the temperature has risen by 5 degrees Celsius, respectively. However, regarding the ratio, the former is not expressed as a 50% increase in temperature, while the latter is not expressed as a 10% increase. In addition, there is no origin 0 in the \"temperature\" used in daily life. In other words, temperature 0 degrees Celsius is not a state in which there is \"no\" temperature, but rather a lower temperature, e.g., \"Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan, was minus 41 degrees Celsius in the winter of 1905\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, it is important to be aware of these differences because it is necessary to choose an appropriate analytical method depending on the nature of the alteration. However, there is no need to memorize the differences in scales in a coherent manner."

    "However, when `<b>2020</b>` is recorded in a file, e.g. in software for data analysis, it reads the `<b></b>` before and after, but this part is not a numerical value and is rubbish in the way of analysis.\n",

    "The xlsx and csv file formats may seem convenient as they can be opened by simply double-clicking on a normal computer, but this is the case when the number of rows of data is relatively small. In the fields of data science and AI, it is not uncommon to handle data with millions or tens of millions of rows. If such data is saved in xlsx or csv format, you will probably have to wait several minutes for the spreadsheet software to start up after double-clicking it and finish loading the file. Also, after start-up, when searching for data, the software will often not respond for several minutes.\n",

    "The reality is that if you have to wait for several minutes every time you perform an operation, you will not be able to work. For such large data, a database is the way to go. In databases, data is basically read and retrieved using SQL commands rather than the mouse. This lesson does not deal with databases, but keep in mind that database manipulation techniques are essential when dealing with large data."
