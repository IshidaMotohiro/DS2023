Here, attributes include age, gender, education, income, place of residence, and so on. Another way to look at it is to know what attributes are common to those who vote for a particular party. The idea is that individuals with similar attributes will have similar political parties (or voting behavior) to vote for.\n",

On the other hand, we have **Vote Data B**, which records the names of the political parties that the voters registered in Data A have voted for in the past. Machine learning is used to learn the relationship between attribute data A and voting data B. Here, we call the parties they voted for in the past as labels. Machine learning learns the relationship between **labels** and various attributes from the data. It is **supervised learning** that discovers the rules that lead to the correct answer, voting data B, from attribute data A.\n",

In other words, the people in attribute data C can be used as the \"voting results\" of the voters in data C. In other words, it is equivalent to dividing the people in attribute data C into \"Liberal Democratic Party,\" \"Constitutional Democratic Party,\" \"Communist Party,\" etc. Such an assignment is called **classification**.\n",

For example, if a woman has a graduate degree in actuarial sciences, we can predict what her annual income would be. This assignment is not about which label (party) they belong to, but about predicting how much of a number (annual income) they will have. This task is called **regression**.\n",

(If a historical data set of unsolicited and non-unsolicited e-mails is provided from the beginning and the system learns from that data, it is called supervised learning. However, since unsolicited e-mails are often cleverly expressed in different ways to avoid detection by anti-virus software, it will be difficult to determine whether an e-mail is unsolicited or not if the model learned once is used as it is.)\n",

    "`smf.ols()` is the function that performs the regression analysis. `rent ~ square` is a notation often used to represent a linear model. It corresponds to $y = b + a x$ (the intercept $b$ and the coefficient $a$ are automatically added, so we don't bother to specify them). The reason for using a tilde (~) instead of `rent = square` is that there is a separate error ($\\epsilon$) ($y = b + a x + \\epsilon$), so they are not equal (the error included in the regression formula is not specified in the code above).\n",

    "Since there is no error in the equation representing this straight line, most of the real-world observed data (black dots) do not lie on (overlap) this line. All of the straight lines pass above or below the real data. In that sense, none of the straight lines fully represent the data. But which straight line dares to be described as close to the real data? In the regression problem, we believe that a straight line that passes between scattered data points is a good representation of the data. This is because the error between the regression line and the data points is generally minimized.\n",

For example, in multiple regression analysis, which we will discuss later, there are multiple explanatory variables. That is, $y = b + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 \\dots a_n x_n$, so there are multiple coefficients $a$ to be estimated. At this time $x_i$ can be the square, logarithm or square root of another $x$ (i.e. $y = b + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 log(x)$), which is **linear** as a model.\n",

    "Suppose now that the regression formula is $f(x) = a x + b$. Substituting a certain value of data for $x$, we obtain the predicted value by the regression formula ($\\hat{y} = f(x)$). By the way, $\\hat{y}$ is read as y hat, meaning predicted values of $y$. The values obtained by subtracting the predicted values from the actual data (error) are called **residuals**. In standard regression analysis, residuals are often analyzed as if they follow a normal distribution, but using the framework of a generalized linear model, a regression model in which errors follow a Poisson distribution can also be used."

    "**multiple regression model** refers to the case in which the regression model in the previous section has two or more explanatory variables. In contrast, a case with one explanatory variable is sometimes called a **single regression model**. If there are $N$ explanatory variables, the model would be $Y = a_1 \\, X_1 + a_2 \\, X_2 + \\dots + a_n \\, X_n$. In multiple regression analysis, it is important to consider the choice of explanatory variables and *interaction* with the response variable. Let us consider the case where the response variable is \"beer consumption per day. First, let us assume that the explanatory variables are \"temperature of the day,\" \"humidity,\" and \"weather. Each of these three variables would, of course, affect the amount of beer consumed. However, if we compare the strength of influence on consumption among these three, we are convinced that \"temperature\" > \"weather\" > \"humidity,\" in that order, with the first two having a particularly large influence. This means that he believes that only two of the response variables, \"temperature\" and \"weather,\" are sufficiently useful to predict the response variable. Choosing explanatory variables in this way is variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, beer sales may be higher on a day when the humidity is high at the same time than on a day when only the temperature is high. This is a synergy effect, but in multiple regression it is called an interaction effect."

    "However, when using multiple explanatory variables, it is not desirable for the correlations between explanatory variables to be too high. In the case of rental housing, two factors that may have an impact on rent are \"time to walk from station\" and \"distance from station. Common sense would dictate that there would be a strong correlation between \"time spent walking from the station\" and \"distance from the station. When there is a strong correlation between explanatory variables, a problem called multicollinearity may arise. When there is multicollinearity among variables, it may not be possible to uniquely determine the values of parameters. Therefore, highly correlated explanatory variables are either removed or integrated (i.e., another third variable is created from the highly correlated variables, etc.)."

    "In the regression model of the previous section, the response variable was real. The regression model can be extended to the case where the response variable is a categorical variable. In particular, when the response variable is binary, it is called a logistic regression model and has a very wide range of applications. binary refers to a categorical variable limited to two levels, such as \"support\" or \"do not support\" the cabinet, \"positive\" or \"negative\" for an inspection, \"success\" or \"failure\" for an attempt, and so on. Since the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable is explored in the data, it is a **supervised learning** model. The purpose of a logistic regression model is to **classify** the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with a binary response variable, it is common in logistic regression models to assign a numerical value of 1 to one and 0 to the other. In other words, the explanatory variable predicts whether the response variable will be 1 or 0.\n",
    "However, what the logistic regression model actually predicts is the probability that the response variable will be 1."

    "Take the example of a housing loan. Suppose we want to predict whether a borrower will default or not. If default is 1 and repayment is 0, logistic regression analysis finds the probability that a customer will default. If this probability is greater than 0.5, it predicts 1 (default); otherwise, it predicts 0 (repayment).\n",
    "Since it is a probability, its value must range from 0 to 1.0. In this section, we will actually run the logistic regression analysis and explain how to interpret the output."

    "Suppose that several measurements ( sex, annual income, education, etc.) are recorded for an individual (e.g., borrower), denoted as $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$. Then, let $z$ be the probability of being 1 (default) for that individual. We would like to set $z = b + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 \\dots + a_n x_n$ in a multiple regression model, but this does not guarantee that $z$ will fall between 0 and 1 as a probability.\n",

If the probability of success is 0.7 (since the probability of failure is 0.3), the odds are 0.7/0.3 = 2.33.

However, if we consider only the result that the coin is turned over three times in five tosses, the probability of the coin turning up is 3/5.

Conversely, since a perfectly correct answer is not assumed, there is no standard by which to judge the correctness of the results. Therefore, the range of application or practicality is limited.
